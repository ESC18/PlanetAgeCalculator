## Description of Application:
This website was built for the purpose of creating and working with TDD via Jest at Epicodus. It takes in 2-3 user inputs (1 to 2 numbers, and a planet selection) and displays to the user their
age if they lived on said selected planet. You can also enter a second number (that being a past age) and it will subtract the past age from your current age to determine 

## Setup and installation requirements/guide:

2. Select 'Code' in the repo page.
3. Copy the provided HTTPS Link.
4. Navigate through Git bash to your desired folder to place the project.
5. Do the necessary git commands to initialize the project and then proceed to do: 'git clone https://github.com/ESC18/PlanetAgeCalculator'
6. Install all packages with _$ npm install_.
7. Build the project using webpack with _$ npm run build_.
8. Start a development server with _$ npm run start_.
9. Lint JS files in the src folder with _$ npm run lint_.
10. Run tests with Jest using _$ npm run test_.

<!--FOR FUTURE UPDATE:
1. State additional info in index.js to NOT insert additional functions or tests for index.js
2. remove index.test.js OR add text saying errors could be caused by running tests and functions within index.js due to imports being present.
3. Fix image error - images do not appear.
4. Provide link to image with font examples.
5. Add additional styling for styles.css (center and clean up hello world text), base styles for a basic site (very simple styling), additional stock images. and     base slightly more extensive HTML setup (with things commented out). Add function that auto generates html/css.
6. Add quick links/resources folder in assets which include good resources and links to documentation to help with coding.
7. Add "jest": true in .eslintrc.
8. In package.json include single line comments that tell the user things they should change: name, version, description, main if needed.
9. In README.md add additional single line comments on things that should be changed if needed.
10. Add Text document that provides additional info to user and access to resources for helping with support. As well as a github pages site that helps display        documentation and a video on usage.
